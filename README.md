Week 6 Challenge @ Makers Academy
=================================


Chatterbox - a twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

Features:
---------

 - To use chatterBOX fully users must sign in
 - Non registered users can view content but cannot contribute
 - Users must log in to post (hoot), reply (hoot 'em back), and see all threads they are active in (hootenannies)
 - Users can log out at any time
 - Users can post a hoot to chatterBOX
 - Hoots are arranged in chronological order of the first post. 
 - On the right hand side of a hoot a user can see the number of hoot em backs associated with the post and can add a new hoot 'em back'
 - Each user can access their Hootenannies page that shows them all hoots they have been active in (either hoots or hoot 'em backs')
 - If a user forgets their password they can request for it to be reset through their registered email account
